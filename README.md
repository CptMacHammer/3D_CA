# Three Dimensional Collision Avoidance

The purpose of this program is to provide an easy way to simulate centralized and decentralized collision avoidance and provide an easy to work with platform to implement collision avoidance algorithms.

## Overview

### Launch file: launch.py
Purpose: Start and run the simulation. 

### Centralized Plane Communication: cenntralizedComm.py
Purpose: Handles the communication betweens planes in a centralized manner. 

### Decentralized Plane Communication: ioComm.py

### Plane Generator: planeGenerator.py
Purpose: Plane object class definition. 

### Simulator: movementSimulator.py
Purpose: Runs a simulation of planes flying.

### Common functions: standardFuncs.py
Purpose: Conversion functions between systems of measurement. 

### Vector Math: vMath.py
Purpose: A generic vector for use in a spherecial coordinate system. 

### Default Values: defaultValues.py
Purpose: Values for constants.
